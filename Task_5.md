## Task 5: Depict the phase diagram of Silicon
### Step 1. Meet with Vivian
Vivian will present the recent studies on the phase diagram of silicon and assign you the target of your internship, which is to determine the phase transition temperature.

### Step 2. PLot the time VS energy & time VS temperature
To easily download file from portal, we are going to do calculation directly under the `scratch` folder (do not need to copy the files under `project` folder to `scratch` folder anymore)

```
cd /expanse/lustre/scratch/YOUR_USER_NAME/temp_project
```
Copy the file shared by Vivian.

```
cp -r /expanse/lustre/projects/csd877/yjia3/share/phase_diagram ./
ls
```
Then you should have your `phase_diagram` folder. 
Omar plots the figures for the lower temperature one.
Viridiana plots the figures for the higher temperature one.
Put the results into the slides. You should also find the figure of RDF vivian has plotted under the folder, please also add them into your slides. If there is not such RDF figure, please plot it by yourselves.
