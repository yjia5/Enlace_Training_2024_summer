### Task 3
## Step 1. Read Literature-Bornâ€“Oppenheimer approximation
Did you watch the movie Oppenheimer? The fundation of molecular dynamic is built by J. Robert Oppenheimer. The main idea is the electrons move much faster than nuclie. Therefore, when we consider able the motion of electrons, we believe the nuclie are fixed. On the other hand, if we consider about the motion of nuclie, we believe they are moving in the force field created by the electrons. As a result, the motion of electrons and nuclie are seperated and the whole complex system is divided into two smaller systems to study.
