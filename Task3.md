### Task 3
## Step 1. Read Literature-Bornâ€“Oppenheimer approximation
Did you watch the movie Oppenheimer? The fundation of molecular dynamic is built by J. Robert Oppenheimer. The main idea is that the electrons move much faster than nuclei. Therefore, when we consider about the motion of electrons, we believe the nuclei are fixed. On the other hand, if we consider about the motion of nuclei, we believe they are moving in the force field created by the electrons. As a result, the motion of electrons and nuclei are seperated and the whole complex system is divided into two smaller systems to study. More detailes can be read by the references or any book including Born-Oppenheimer approximation:
