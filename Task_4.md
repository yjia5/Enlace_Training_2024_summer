## Task 4: Downstream analysis the result
### Step 1. Reed Literature - Radial distribution functions (RDF)
The atomic structure can be characterized by many parameters. One ordinary parameter used is radial distribution functions. Read the following reference to understand what it is.

The system we are going to study is Silicon (Si). We are going to study different phases of Si, including liquid, crystal and amorphous phases. Read these literatures to find the differences in the RDFs of these three phases. Please work together and write a few paragrphas to describe the differences.

### Step 2. Run Python on expanse
### Step 3. Plot time VS energy & time VS temperature
### Step 4. Visualize 
### Step 5. Calculate RDF
